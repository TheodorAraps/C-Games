# C++ Games
This repository contains 2 C++ games, developed using the SFML Library. 
The first one is the Timber (Timberman 2D game clone) and the second is the Zombie Arena game.
Both the games are based on ideas and concepts from "Beginning C++ Game Programming" by John Horton.

Check "README" inside each directory for more info.
